Today was my first successful attempt at running this.  I've included the
output below.  As you can see, I didn't get very far, and that was after nearly
twelve hours.  This was on my AMD FX(tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor, with 16 GiB
of RAM.

I observed resource utilization while it was running.  It consumed about 6 GiB
of resident RAM (10 GiB virtual), and really only used one core.  So, what I
need to work on next is getting it to take advantage of multiple cores.

The other thing I need to work on is getting the output into a format that's a
bit easier to read.  Sure, this is usable, but you have to cross-reference it
with the tumbler definitions to get something more readily readable.  Also, I
have yet to verify that these are actually valid solutions.
