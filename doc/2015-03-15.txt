At my current estimate, this will take 150 hours to run to completion
on my desktop machine.  And it seems to only use a quarter of the
total CPU capacity while running, since switching to using pmap, which
is twice what it used before switching to pmap (it also uses all eight
cores more evenly, spending less time juggling between them).

Conclusions:
 - I need to step-up the utilization
 - I need to make this checkpoint itself, so that it can be interrupted and pick-up again where it left off
